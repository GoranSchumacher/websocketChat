This is your new Play application
=================================

This is an ordinary Play app.
Start by running activator run or activator start

It can also be started from within your IDE with Play support,
for instance IntelliJ with Play and Scala plugin installed.

I could have built this code on top of the Activator example Clustered-chat
but I thibk that would have been over kill for this simple example.
Clustered-chat uses actors, coffee script and twitter bootstrap html rendering.

Controllers
===========

Simply call http://localhost:9000 and you will be presented with a screen where you can enter your chat name.

Submit and start chatting at the chat page.
